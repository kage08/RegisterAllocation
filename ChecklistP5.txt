3) Have you removed all the class files and jar files from your tar ball?

4) Does your base folder contain P5.java that can be compiled using javac?

5) Does your P5.java take input from the standard input (for usage of redirection) ?

6) Does your P5.java write output to the standard output (for usage of redirection) ?

Any other comments:

regAlloc folder contains Structures for Basic blocks, Variable ranges and Procedure information and implementation of Linear Scan. UseDefConsTr.java constructs deft and use.

The CFG is constructed in FunInfo of individual procedure. Translator.java finally converts microRA code to miniRA using registers assigned for each variable by Linear Scan.

Thankyou!
